# Solving Cart-Pole Environment using Deep Reinforcement Learning

The goal of the agent is to survive the longest duration possible by balancing a Pole on a Cart that can move left and right. For mor detail: [Gymnasium Docs](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/classic_control/cart_pole/)

# Purpose

The only reason this project exists is to put what I have learned so far about DQNs into practice.
